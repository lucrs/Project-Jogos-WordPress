== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this sidebar plugin work with my theme? =

Yes!

If your theme already has WordPress sidebars and widget areas, you can create new custom sidebars to replace, merge with or hide those on certain conditions.

If it doesn't, it is still possible to display custom sidebars using the function ca_display_sidebar() in your theme or using the sidebar shortcode [ca-sidebar] in your content.

= Can I really display sidebars and widget areas on any page? =

Yep.

In the Sidebar Editor, you can select on what conditions your sidebar should be displayed. Create a sidebar for each page, a sidebar for posts in a category, or any sidebar you need.
You can also select sidebars directly when you're editing a post or page.
